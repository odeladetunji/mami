MAMI WEBSITE
Its running on a NODEJS Server! with ExpressJS Web framework!
It was built from scratch so that it will be easily extendable 
(with the intent that the ministry will always expand and give birth to other platforms which may be totally dependent on software technology to run, else the site could have been easily built with wordpress or other content management system) by any developer which will be working on it in future!

you can pull it to local repository with

git pull request!
